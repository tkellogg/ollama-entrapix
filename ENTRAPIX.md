# Entrapix (Entropix, but with Traps)

This is a fork of Ollama that applies a small part of
[entropix](https://github.com/xjdr-alt/entropix). The full entropix is an experiment
with dynamic samplers.

Entrapix doesn't take most of the ideas from entropix, only the core idea of using
logit entropy & varentropy and plotting them against each other to classify the LLM
generation state.

In both entrapix and entropix, the generation state is classified into 4 states (actually 
more than that in entropix) using entropy & varentropy of the logits. In original entropix, they
have downstream algorithms for dynamically adjusting `top_p`, `top_k`, `temperature`, etc.
in response to the sampler state.

Entrapix takes a different route. As an application developer, if the LLM is confused, I
want to know, I want to treat that like any other exception. I want this, because I often
can respond by providing even more context, or ask the user what they mean. Regardless, I
certainly would love to monitor these sorts of events, from an operational perspective.

| | Low Entropy | High Entropy |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Low Varentropy | Easy, churn out tokens |  |
| High Varentropy |  | Uncertainty! `raise ConfusedAgentError()` |


## Usage

The CLI tool is wired up correctly. At minimum, the `--entrapix true` flag is needed to
enable this behavior.

```shell
‚ùØ ./ollama run llama3.1 "How much energy is required for the information contained in a bowling ball to escape a black hole?" --entrapix true --entrapix-threshold 1 --entrapix-varent 1
A fun and imaginative question!

In theory, if we were to place a bowling ball near the event horizon of a black hole, its information would indeed be 
affected by the strong gravitational field.

However,

Error: agent is confused and has stopped
```

In addition to quitting early & printing out the error, it also returns a nonzero status 
code, so this should work in scripts as well.

The API also sets `"done_reason": "trap"` if it stopped early. I haven't updated any 
clients other than the CLI tool.

You should also be able to set these parameters in the modelfile, although I haven't
tried that yet. I assume that would be the ideal place to set the thresholds.
